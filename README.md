# Data-Analysis-with-python
The motive of the project is to implement various Data Analytics tools within python libraries-Pandas and Numpy.
The project contains 6 files each containing an exercise on Data Analysis.Each file has it's own dataset and is based on a different problem statement.

Exercise 1:DATA SORTING AND FILTERING:

i)Using pandas,we have created a dataframe object of the given dataset.
ii)We are accessing diferent rows and columns of the dataframe.
iii)Sorting the entire dataframe based on specific columns.
iv)Filtering rows/columns based on letters/numbers in data of the columns.
v)Building another dataframes using selected columns.
vi)Calculating mean values of specific columns.


Exercise 2:GROUPING AND SORTING:

In this exercise,we have used a dataset containing crime rates of US in 1960-70s.We had found the most dangerous decade on the basis of the categories of crime.
i)Viewing and changing datatypes of columns.
ii)Changing indexes of columns.
iii)Decade wise grouping years and decade wise crime analysis.

Exercise 3:CLEANING DATASET:

i)Adding/deleting columns
ii)Combining multiple dataframes.

Exercise 4:DEALING WITH NULL VALUES:

i)Assigning null values to specific locations.
ii)Column wise counting null values.
iii)Deleting rows with null values.

Exercise 5:CHANGING THE FREQUENCY OF DATA:

Converting random data to daily,montly and early data orgnaizing it for analysis.
i)Changing datatypes of teh indexes to change the frequency of the data.

Bonus exercise:WORKING WITH OPENDATASETS:

Exploratory analysis of the data to find the biggest video game producing franchise based on data provided by global sales
